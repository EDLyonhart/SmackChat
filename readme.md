SmackChat:

For the final project of WDI-SF-16 I have decided to recreat as much of the functionality of the application 'SlackChat' as possible.

I intend to use the following technologies:
    Node.js
    Socket.io
    Redis
    Express.js
    ajax
    
    more to be added as necessary.

...


Node.js does not behave in the manor that I expect it to, and I am having a difficult tyme with work-arounds.

In retrospect, I believe there are lots of packages / modules which I should have used to accomplish the tasks that I'm struggling with. Node.js is such a minimal framework that I should have invested more tyme into figuring out how to use modules.

...


In addition to the above, I realize now that I should have sought help much earlier on before commiting to, and entrenching, several bad practices. Getting help earlier on would have helped me move through problems quicker, helped me create less brittle solutions, alowed me to move on to more of my goals.

...


Time to present to class. I havent yet been able to deploy to heroku. Display from the 'loggedInUsers' list is not reloading properly (it only reloads when the server hiccups).

Refactoring is definitely still a possibility, but instead, I think I will start from the ground up, figure out the appropriate modules to use in the appropriate place and cannibalize pieces from this application where applicaple.
